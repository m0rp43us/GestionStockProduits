## Technologies used

## Angular

Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers, instead it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic. Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding. And it's caracterized by its modularity, which means much core functionality has moved to modules.


## Springboot

The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.
