## Technologies used

## Angular

AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications. (This flexibility has led to the acronym MVW, which stands for "model-view-whatever" and may also encompass model–view–presenter and model–view–adapter.) In 2014, the original AngularJS team began working on the Angular web framework. 


## Springboot

The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.
